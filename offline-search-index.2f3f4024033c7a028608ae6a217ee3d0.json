They are associated with a name for easy reference, a time line, a lead (the user account of the main person conducting the testing), a test strategy, and a status. Engagement consists of two types: Interactive and CI/CD. An interactive engagement is typically an engagement conducted by an engineer, where findings are usually uploaded by the engineer. A CI/CD engagement, as it’s name suggests, is for automated integration with a CI/CD pipeline.\n Examples:  Beta Quarterly PCI Scan Release Version X    Test Tests are a grouping of activities conducted by engineers to attempt to discover flaws in a product. Tests are bundled within engagements, have a start and end date and are defined by a test type.\n Examples:  Burp Scan from Oct. 29, 2015 to Oct. 29, 2015 Nessus Scan from Oct. 31, 2015 to Oct. 31, 2015 API Test from Oct. 15, 2015 to Oct. 20, 2015    Finding A finding represents a flaw discovered while testing.

DefectDojo collapses duplicate Findings by capturing the individual hosts vulnerable.\nThis approach will create a new Test for each upload. This can result a lot of findings. If deduplication is enabled, new findings that are identical to existing findings get marked as a duplicate.\nReimport Additionally, DefectDojo allows for re-imports of previously uploaded reports. This greatly reduces the amount of findings as no duplicates are created for findings that already exist.\nDefectDojo will attempt to capture the deltas between the original and new import and automatically add or mitigate findings as appropriate.\nThis behaviour can be controled via the closed_old_findings parameter on the reupload form.\nThe history of a test will be shown with the delta’s for each reimported scan report. Clicking on a reimport changset will show the affected findings, as well as a status history per finding. Triage-less scanners Some scanners might not include triage information in their reports, such as tfsec for example. They simply scan code or dependencies, flag issues, and return everything. Removing some findings requires you to add comments in your code perhaps, but there is no simple way to filter out findings from the reports.\nThat is why DefectDojo also includes a “Do not reactivate” checkbox in uploading reports (also in the reimport API), so you can persist the triages that have been done in Defectdojo without reactivating issues on every upload.\nFor context, see #6892\nAPI This section focuses on Import and Reimport via the API. Please see the full documentation details of all API Endpoints for more details. Reimport is actually the easiest way to get started as it will create any entities on the fly if needed and it will automatically detect if it is a first time upload or a re-upload.\nImport Importing via the API is performed via the import-scan endpoint.\nAs described in the Core Data Classes, a test gets created inside an Engagement, inside a Product, inside a Product Type.\nAn import can be performed by specifying the names of these entities in the API request:\n{ \"minimum_severity\": 'Info', \"active\": True, \"verified\": True, \"scan_type\": 'ZAP Scan', \"test_title\": 'Manual ZAP Scan by John', \"product_type_name\": 'Good Products', \"product_name\": 'My little product', \"engagement_name\": 'Important import', \"auto_create_context\": True, } When auto_create_context is True, the product and engagement will be created if needed. Make sure your user has sufficient permissions to do this.\nA classic way of importing a scan is by specifying the ID of the engagement instead:\n{ \"minimum_severity\": 'Info', \"active\": True, \"verified\": True, \"scan_type\": 'ZAP Scan', \"test_title\": 'Manual ZAP Scan by John', \"engagement\": 123, } Reimport ReImporting via the API is performed via the reimport-scan endpoint.\nAn reimport can be performed by specifying the names of these entities in the API request:\n{ \"minimum_severity\": 'Info', \"active\": True, \"verified\": True, \"scan_type\": 'ZAP Scan', \"test_title\": 'Manual ZAP Scan by John', \"product_type_name\": 'Good Products', \"product_name\": 'My little product', \"engagement_name\": 'Important import', \"auto_create_context\": True, \"do_not_reactivate\": False, } When auto_create_context is True, the product and engagement will be created if needed. Make sure your user has sufficient permissions to do this.\nWhen do_not_reactivate is True, the importing/reimporting will ignore uploaded active findings and not reactivate previously closed findings, while still creating new findings if there are new ones. You will get a note on the finding to explain that it was not reactivated for that reason.\nA Reimport will automatically select the latest test inside the provided engagement that satisifes the provided scan_type and (optionally) provided test_title\nIf no existing Test is found, the reimport endpoint will use the import function to import the provided report into a new Test. This means a (CI/CD) script using the API doesn’t need to know if a Test already exist, or if it is a first time upload for this product / engagement.\nA classic way of reimporting a scan is by specifying the ID of the test instead:\n{ \"minimum_severity\": 'Info', \"active\": True, \"verified\": True, \"scan_type\": 'ZAP Scan', \"test\": 123, } Using the Scan Completion Date (API: scan_date) field DefectDojo offers a plethora of supported scanner reports, but not all of them contain the information most important to a user. The scan_date field is a flexible smart feature that allows users to set the completion date of the a given scan report, and have it propagate down to all the findings imported. This field is not mandatory, but the default value for this field is the date of import (whenever the request is processed and a successful response is returned).\nHere are the following use cases for using this field:\n The report does not set the date, and scan_date is not set at import  Finding date will be the default value of scan_date   The report sets the date, and the scan_date is not set at import  Finding date will be whatever the report sets   The report does not set the date, and the scan_date is set at import  Finding date will be whatever the user set for scan_date   The report sets the date, and the scan_date is set at import  Finding date will be whatever the user set for scan_date    ","categories":"","description":"How DefectDojo imports and reimports security tool reports.","excerpt":"How DefectDojo imports and reimports security tool reports.","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/integrations/importing/","tags":"","title":"Importing"},{"body":" Information All commands assume that you’re located at the root of the django-DefectDojo cloned repo.

Set up your environment to use the debug environment, such as:\n$ docker/setEnv.sh debug\nPlease have a look at DOCKER.md for more details.\nDocker images You’d want to build your docker images locally, and eventually pass in your local user’s uid to be able to write to the image (handy for database migration files).

To have your parser loaded and works correctly, you need to implement the contract.\n your parser MUST be in a sub-module of module dojo.tools  ex: dojo.tools.my_tool.parser module   your parser MUST be a class in this sub-module.  ex: dojo.tools.my_tool.parser.MyToolParser   The name of this class MUST be the Python module name without underscores and with Parser suffix.  ex: dojo.tools.my_tool.parser.MyToolParser   This class MUST have an empty constructor or no constructor This class MUST implement 3 methods:  def get_scan_types(self) This function return a list of all the scan_type supported by your parser. This identifiers are used internally. Your parser can support more than one scan_type. For example some parsers use different identifier to modify the behavior of the parser (aggregate, filter, etc…) def get_label_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): This function return a string used to provide some text in the UI (short label) def get_description_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): This function return a string used to provide some text in the UI (long description) def get_findings(self, file, test) This function return a list of findings   If your parser have more than 1 scan_type (for detailled mode) you MUST implement def set_mode(self, mode) method  Example:\nclass MyToolParser(object): def get_scan_types(self): return [\"My Tool Scan\", \"My Tool Scan detailed\"] def get_label_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): if scan_type == \"My Tool Scan\": return \"My Tool XML Scan aggregated by ...\" else: return \"My Tool XML Scan\" def get_description_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): return \"Aggregates findings per cwe, title, description, file_path.

In that case, an “API parser” is needed. Core code is the same as a regular parser but there are some additional requirements.\nWhich files do you need to modify? (API Parsers only)    File Purpose     dojo/tools/api_\u003cparser_dir\u003e/api_client.py API client should perform all HTTP API calls and JSON with data from the API   dojo/tools/api_\u003cparser_dir\u003e/importer.py Importer should prepare the API client and process its results   dojo/tools/api_\u003cparser_dir\u003e/parser.py Parser should fetch processed data from the importer   unittests/tools/test_api_\u003cparser_name\u003e_parser.py Unit tests of the parser.   unittests/tools/test_api_\u003cparser_name\u003e_importer.py Unit tests of the importer.   dojo/tool_config/factory.py Parser must be listed in SCAN_APIS   unittests/test_tool_config.py Unit tests for content of hints and other metadata    Factory contract (API Parsers only)  Parser directory MUST starts with api_  ex: dojo/tools/api_mytool   class-name of parser MUST starts with Api  ex: ApiMytoolParser   Parser MUST implements function def api_scan_configuration_hint(self) which returns a string with a hint, on how to configure service keys in Product …TODO. Using of HTML tag \u003cb\u003e is required. Help will be rendered on the website.  ex: return 'the field \u003cb\u003eService key 1\u003c/b\u003e has to be set to ID of the project. \u003cb\u003eService key 2\u003c/b\u003e has to be set to the version of the project'   Parser MUST implemets function def requires_tool_type(self, scan_type) which returns name of the required Tool_Type. Parser MUST NOT create related Tool_Type. It will be created automatically based on the function requires_tool_type. API client SHOULD implemets def test_connection(self): and def test_product_connection(self, api_scan_configuration): to be able to test connectivity and test permissions. It should return string with a sucessfull status (like you have access to 125 projects) or raise an exception.  Template Generator Use the template parser to quickly generate the files required. To get started you will need to install cookiecutter.\n$ pip install cookiecutter Then generate your scanner parser from the root of django-DefectDojo:\n$ cookiecutter https://github.com/DefectDojo/cookiecutter-scanner-parser Read more on the template configuration variables.\nThings to pay attention to Here is a list of advise that will make your parser future proof.\nDo not parse URLs by hand We use 2 modules to handle endpoints:\n hyperlink dojo.models with a specific class to handle processing around URLs to create endpoints Endpoint.  All the existing parser use the same code to parse URL and create endpoints. Using Endpoint.from_uri() is the best way to create endpoints. If you really need to parse an URL, use hyperlink module.\nGood example:\nif \"url\" in item: endpoint = Endpoint.from_uri(item[\"url\"]) finding.unsaved_endpoints = [endpoint] Very bad example:\nu = urlparse(item[\"url\"]) endpoint = Endpoint(host=u.host) finding.unsaved_endpoints = [endpoint] Not all attributes are mandatory Parsers may have many fields, out of which many of them may be optional. It better to not set attribute if you don’t have data instead of filling with values like NA, No data etc…\nCheck class dojo.models.Finding\nData could be missing in the source report Always make sure you include checks to avoid potential KeyError errors (e.g. field does not exist), for those fields you are not absolutely certain will always be in file that will get uploaded. These translate to 500 error, and do not look good.\nGood example:\nif \"mykey\" in data: finding.cve = data[\"mykey\"] Do not parse CVSS by hand (vector, score or severity) Data can have CVSS vectors or scores. Don’t try to write your own CVSS score algorithm. For parser, we rely on module cvss.\nIt’s easy to use and will make the parser aligned with the rest of the code.\nExample of use:\nfrom cvss.cvss3 import CVSS3 import cvss.parser vectors = cvss.parser.parse_cvss_from_text(\"CVSS:3.0/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/E:H/RL:O/RC:R/CR:H/IR:X/AR:X/MAC:H/MPR:X/MUI:X/MC:L/MA:X\") if len(vectors) \u003e 0 and type(vectors[0]) == CVSS3: print(vectors[0].severities()) # this is the 3 severities cvssv3 = vectors[0].clean_vector() severity = vectors[0].severities()[0] vectors[0].compute_base_score() cvssv3_score = vectors[0].scores()[0] print(severity) print(cvssv3_score) Good example:\nvectors = cvss.parser.parse_cvss_from_text(item['cvss_vect']) if len(vectors) \u003e 0 and type(vectors[0]) == CVSS3: finding.cvss = vectors[0].clean_vector() finding.severity = vectors[0].severities()[0] # if your tool does generate severity Bad example (DIY):\ndef get_severity(self, cvss, cvss_version=\"2.0\"): cvss = float(cvss) cvss_version = float(cvss_version[:1]) # If CVSS Version 3 and above if cvss_version \u003e= 3: if cvss \u003e 0 and cvss \u003c 4: return \"Low\" elif cvss \u003e= 4 and cvss \u003c 7: return \"Medium\" elif cvss \u003e= 7 and cvss \u003c 9: return \"High\" elif cvss \u003e= 9: return \"Critical\" else: return \"Informational\" # If CVSS Version prior to 3 else: if cvss \u003e 0 and cvss \u003c 4: return \"Low\" elif cvss \u003e= 4 and cvss \u003c 7: return \"Medium\" elif cvss \u003e= 7 and cvss \u003c= 10: return \"High\" else: return \"Informational\" Deduplication algorithm By default a new parser uses the ‘legacy’ deduplication algorithm documented at https://documentation.defectdojo.com/usage/features/#deduplication-algorithms\nUnit tests Each parser must have unit tests, at least to test for 0 vuln, 1 vuln and many vulns. You can take a look at how other parsers have them for starters. The more quality tests, the better.\nIt’s important to add checks on attributes of findings. For ex:\nwith self.subTest(i=0): finding = findings[0] self.assertEqual(\"test title\", finding.title) self.assertEqual(True, finding.active) self.assertEqual(True, finding.verified) self.assertEqual(False, finding.duplicate) self.assertIn(finding.severity, Finding.SEVERITIES) self.assertEqual(\"CVE-2020-36234\", finding.cve) self.assertEqual(261, finding.cwe) self.assertEqual(\"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\", finding.cvssv3) self.assertIn(\"security\", finding.tags) self.assertIn(\"network\", finding.tags) self.assertEqual(\"3287f2d0-554f-491b-8516-3c349ead8ee5\", finding.unique_id_from_tool) self.assertEqual(\"TEST1\", finding.vuln_id_from_tool) Test database To test your unit tests locally, you first need to grant some rights. Get your MySQL root password from the docker-compose logs, login as root and issue the following commands:\nMYSQL\u003e grant all privileges on test_defectdojo.* to defectdojo@'%'; MYSQL\u003e flush privileges; Run your tests This local command will launch the unit test for your new parser\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test unittests.tools.\u003cyour_unittest_py_file\u003e.\u003cmain_class_name\u003e -v2' Example for the blackduck hub parser:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test unittests.tools.test_blackduck_csv_parser.TestBlackduckHubParser -v2' Information If you want to run all unit tests, simply run $ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test unittests -v2'  Endpoint validation Some types of parsers create a list of endpoints that are vulnerable (they are stored in finding.unsaved_endpoints). DefectDojo requires storing endpoints in a specific format (which follow RFCs). Endpoints that do not follow this format can be stored but they will be marked as broken (red flag 🚩in UI). To be sure your parse store endpoints in the correct format run the .clean() function for all endpoints in unit tests\nfindings = parser.get_findings(testfile, Test()) for finding in findings: for endpoint in finding.unsaved_endpoints: endpoint.clean() Tests API Parsers Not only parser but also importer should be tested. patch method from unittest.mock is usualy usefull for simulating API responses. It is highly recommeded to use it.\nOther files that could be involved Change to the model In the event where you’d have to change the model, e.g. to increase a database column size to accomodate a longer string of data to be saved\n  Change what you need in dojo/models.py\n  Create a new migration file in dojo/db_migrations by running and including as part of your PR\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py makemigrations -v2'    Accept a different type of file to upload If you want to be able to accept a new type of file for your parser, take a look at dojo/forms.py around line 436 (at the time of this writing) or locate the 2 places (for import and re-import) where you find the string attrs={\"accept\":.\nFormats currently accepted: .xml, .csv, .nessus, .json, .html, .js, .zip.\nA need for more than just the parser.py Of course, nothing prevents you from having more files than the parser.py file.

We are in the process of simplifying this by making the DefectDojo API smarter (so api wrappers / script can be dumber).\n","categories":"","description":"DefectDojo's API lets you automate tasks, e.g. uploading scan reports in CI/CD pipelines.","excerpt":"DefectDojo's API lets you automate tasks, e.g. uploading scan reports …","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/integrations/api-v2-docs/","tags":"","title":"DefectDojo API v2"},{"body":"The documentation is build with Hugo and uses the theme Docsy.

A finding status can change to accepted by doing the following. Findings are accepted in the engagement view. To locate the engagement from the finding click the link to engagement as shown below.\nThen, in the engagement view click the plus icon in the 'Risk Acceptance' box and fill in the details to support the risk acceptance.\nThe engagement view is now updated with the risk.\nThe finding status changes to 'Accepted' with a link to the risk acceptance.\nDeduplication Deduplication is a feature that when enabled will compare findings to automatically identify duplicates. When deduplication is enabled, a list of deduplicated findings is added to the engagement view. The following image illustrates the option deduplication on engagement and deduplication on product level:\nUpon saving a finding, defectDojo will look at the other findings in the product or the engagement (depending on the configuration) to find duplicates\nWhen a duplicate is found:\n The newly imported finding takes status: inactive, duplicate An \"Original\" link is displayed after the finding status, leading to the original finding  There are two ways to use the deduplication:\n Deduplicate vulnerabilities in the same build/release. The vulnerabilities may be found by the same scanner (same scanner deduplication) or by different scanners (cross-scanner deduplication). this helps analysis and assessment of the technical debt, especially if using many different scanners; although detecting duplicates across scanners is not trivial as it requires a certain standardization. Track unique vulnerabilities across builds/releases so that defectDojo knows when it finds a vulnerability whether it has seen it before.  this allows you keep information attached to a given finding in a unique place: all further duplicate findings will point to the original one.\n  Deduplication configuration Global configuration The deduplication can be activated in \"System Settings\" by ticking \"Deduplicate findings\".\nAn option to delete duplicates can be found in the same menu, and the maximum number of duplicates to keep for the same finding can be configured.\nEngagement configuration When creating an engagement or later by editing the engagement, the \"Deduplication within engagement only\" checkbox can be ticked.\n If activated: Findings are only deduplicated within the same engagement. Findings present in different engagements cannot be duplicates Else: Findings are deduplicated across the whole product  Note that deduplication can never occur across different products.\nDeduplication algorithms The behavior of the deduplication can be configured for each parser in settings.dist.py (or settings.py after install) by configuring the DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER variable, or via the env variable (useful for Kubernetes deployments) DD_DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER with a JSON string like\n{\"ScannerName\":\"algorithm\"} The environment variable will override the settings in settings.dist.py, replacing by matching the keys.\nThe available algorithms are:\n DEDUPE_ALGO_UNIQUE_ID_FROM_TOOL The deduplication occurs based on finding.unique_id_from_tool which is a unique technical id existing in the source tool. Few scanners populate this field currently. If you want to use this algorithm, you may need to update the scanner code beforehand.  Advantages:  If your source tool has a reliable means of tracking a unique vulnerability across scans, this configuration will allow defectDojo to use this ability.   Drawbacks:  Using this algorithm will not allow cross-scanner deduplication as other tools will have a different technical id. When the tool evolves, it may change the way the unique id is generated. In that case you won't be able to recognise that findings found in previous scans are actually the same as the new findings.     DEDUPE_ALGO_HASH_CODE The deduplication occurs based on finding.hash_code. The hash_code itself is configurable for each scanner in parameter HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER. DEDUPE_ALGO_UNIQUE_ID_FROM_TOOL_OR_HASH_CODE A finding is a duplicate with another if they have the same unique_id_from_tool OR the same hash_code.  Allows to use both  a technical deduplication (based on unique_id_from_tool) for a reliable same-parser deduplication and a functional one (based on hash_code configured on CWE+severity+file_path for example) for cross-parser deduplication     DEDUPE_ALGO_LEGACY This is algorithm that was in place before the configuration per parser was made possible, and also the default one for backward compatibility reasons.  Legacy algorithm basically deduplicates based on:  For static scanner: ['title', 'cwe', 'line', 'file_path', 'description'] For dynamic scanner: ['title', 'cwe', 'line', 'file_path', 'description', 'endpoints']    Note that there are some subtleties that may give unexpected results. Switch dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication to debug in settings.py to get more info in case of trouble.\n  Hash_code computation configuration The hash_code computation can be configured for each parser using the parameter HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER in settings.dist.py, or via the env variable (useful for Kubernetes deployments) DD_HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER with a JSON string like\n{\"ScannerName\":[\"field1\", \"field2\"]} The environment variable will override the settings in settings.dist.py, replacing by matching the keys.\nThe parameter HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS list the fields from finding table that were tested and are known to be working when used as a hash_code. Don't hesitate to enrich this list when required (the code is generic and allows adding new fields by configuration only)\nNote that endpoints isn't a field from finding table but rather a meta value that will trigger a computation based on all the endpoints.\nWhen populating HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER, please respect the order of declaration of the fields: use the same order as in HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS: that will allow cross-scanner deduplication to function because the hash_code is computed as a sha-256 of concatenated values of the configured fields.\nTips:\n  It's advised to use fields that are standardized for a reliable deduplication, especially if aiming at cross-scanner deduplication. For example title and description tend to change when the tools evolve and don't allow cross-scanner deduplication\n Good candidates are  cwe or cve Adding the severity will make sure the deduplication won't be to aggressive (there are several families of XSS and sql injection for example, with various severities but the same cwe). Adding the file_path or endpoints is advised too.      The parameter HASHCODE_ALLOWS_NULL_CWE will allow switching to legacy algorithm when a null cwe is found for a given finding: this is to avoid getting many duplicates when the tool fails to give a cwe while we are expecting it.\n  Hashcode generation / regeneration When you change the hashcode configuration, it is needed to regenerated the hashcodes for all findings, or at least those findings found by scanners for which the configuration was updated.\nThis is sometimes also needed after an upgrade to a new Defect Dojo version, for example when we made changes to the hashcode configuration or calculation logic. We will mention this in the upgrade notes.\nTo regenerate the hashcodes, use the dedupe management command:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only This will only regenerated the hashcodes, but will not run any deduplication logic on existing findings. If you want to run deduplication again on existing findings to make sure any duplicates found by the new hashcode config are marked as such, run\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe The deduplication part of this command will run the deduplication for each finding in a celery task. If you want to run the deduplication in the foreground process, use:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --dedupe_sync Please note the deduplication process is resource intensive and can take a long time to complete (estimated ~7500 findings per minute when run in the foreground)\nDebugging deduplication There is a specific logger that can be activated in order to have details about the deduplication process : switch dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication to debug in settings.dist.py.\nDeduplication - APIv2 parameters  skip_duplicates: if true, duplicates are not inserted at all close_old_findings : if true, findings that are not duplicates and that were in the previous scan of the same type (example ZAP) for the same engagement (or product in case of \"close_old_findings_product_scope\") and that are not present in the new scan are closed (Inactive, Verified, Mitigated). close_old_findings_product_scope : if true, close_old_findings applies to all findings of the same type in the product. Note that \"Deduplication on engagement\" is no longer used to determine the scope of close_old_findings.  Deduplication / Similar findings Similar Findings Visualization:\n Similar Findings While viewing a finding, similar findings within the same product are listed along with buttons to mark one finding a duplicate of the other. Clicking the \"Use as original\" button on a similar finding will mark that finding as the original while marking the viewed finding as a duplicate. Clicking the \"Mark as duplicate\" button on a similar finding will mark that finding as a duplicate of the viewed finding. If a similar finding is already marked as a duplicate, then a \"Reset duplicate status\" button is shown instead which will remove the duplicate status on that finding along with marking it active again.  False Positive Removal DefectDojo allows users to tune out false positives by enabling False Positive History. This will track what engineers have labeled as false positive for a specific product and for a specific scanner. While enabled, when a tool reports the same issue that has been flagged as a false positive previously, it will automatically mark the finding as a false positive, helping to tune overly verbose security tools.\nFalse Positive Removal is not needed when using deduplication, and it is advised to not combine these two.\nService Level Agreement (SLA) DefectDojo allows you to maintain your security SLA and automatically remind teams whenever a SLA is about to get breached, or breaches.\nSimply indicate in the System Settings for each severity, how many days teams have to remediate a finding.\nSLA notification configuration There are 3 variables in the system settings that can be set for notifcations of SLA breaches. By default notifications are disabled. You can either choose to notify about breaches for findings that are only in ‘Active’ or for any findings across the instance that are in Active, Verified. Furthermore, it is possible choose to only consider findings that have a JIRA issue linked to them.\nThere are 2 variables in the settings.py file that you can configure, to act on the global behavior.\nSLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH = 3 SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH = 7 The SLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH is expressed in days. Whenever a finding's \"SLA countdown\" (time to remediate) drops to this number, a notification would be sent everyday, as scheduled by the crontab in settings.py, until the day it breaches.\nThe SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH lets you define in days how long you want to be kept notified about findings that have breached the SLA. Passed that number, notifications will cease.\nWarning Be mindful of performance if you choose to have SLA notifications on non-verified findings, especially if you import a lot of findings through CI in 'active' state.  What notification channels for SLA notifications? The same as usual. You will notice that an extra SLA breach option is now present on the Notification page and also in the Product view.\nSLA notification with JIRA You can choose to also send SLA notification as JIRA comments, if your product is configured with JIRA. You can enable it at the JIRA configuration level or at the Product level.\nThe Product level JIRA notification configuration takes precendence over the global JIRA notification configuration.\nWhen is the SLA notification job run? The default setup will trigger the SLA notification code at 7:30am on a daily basis, as defined in the settings.py file. You can of course modify this schedule to your context.\n'compute-sla-age-and-notify': { 'task': 'dojo.tasks.async_sla_compute_and_notify', 'schedule': crontab(hour=7, minute=30), } Information The celery containers are the ones concerned with this configuration. If you suspect things are not working as expected, make sure they have the latest version of your settings.py file.  You can of course change this default by modifying that stanza.\nLaunching from the CLI You can also invoke the SLA notification function from the CLI. For example, if run from docker-compose:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c 'python manage.py sla_notifications' Reports Instant reports Instant reports can be generated for:\n Product types Products Engagements Tests List of Findings Endpoints  Filtering is available on all report generation views to aid in focusing the report for the appropriate need.\nCustom reports Custom reports, generated with the Report Builder, allow you to select specific components to be added to the report. These include:\n Cover Page Table of Contents WYSIWYG Content Findings Vulnerable Endpoints Page Breaks  DefectDojo’s reports can be generated in HTML and AsciiDoc.\nMetrics DefectDojo provides a number of metrics visualization in order to help with reporting, awareness and to be able to quickly communicate a products/product type's security stance.\nThe following metric views are provided:\n Product Type Metrics This view provides graphs displaying Open Bug Count by Month, Accepted Bug Count by Month, Open Bug Count by Week, Accepted Bug Count by Week as well as tabular data on Top 10 Products by bug severity, Detail Breakdown of all reported findings, Opened Findings, Accepted Findings, Closed Findings, Trending Open Bug Count, Trending Accepted Bug Count, and Age of Issues.  Product Type Counts This view provides tabular data of Total Current Security Bug Count, Total Security Bugs Opened In Period, Total Security Bugs Closed In Period, Trending Total Bug Count By Month, Top 10 By Bug Severity, and Open Findings. This view works great for communication with stakeholders as it is a snapshot in time of the product.  Simple Metrics Provides tabular data for all Product Types. The data displayed in this view is the total number of S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, Opened This Month, and Closed This Month.  Engineer Metrics Provides graphs displaying information about a tester's activity.  Metrics Dashboard Provides a full screen, auto scroll view with many metrics in graph format. This view is great for large displays or \"Dashboards.\"   Users DefectDojo users inherit from django.contrib.auth.models.User.\nA username, first name, last name, and email address can be associated with each user. Additionally the following attributes describe the type of users:\n Active Designates whether this user should be treated as active and can login to DefectDojo. Unselect this instead of deleting accounts. Superuser status Designates that this user can configure the system and has all permissions for objects without explicitly assigning them.  A superuser may force a password reset for any user at any given time. This can be set when creating a new user, or when editing an existing one, requiring the user to change their password upon their next login.\nDefectDojo enforces the following password rules for all users:\n Must meet a length requirement of 9 characters Must be unique (not commonly used) Must contain one of each of the following: a number (0-9), uppercase letter (A-Z), lowercase letter (a-z), and symbol ()[]{}|~!@#$%^\u0026*_-+=;:`'\",\u003c\u003e./?  Calendar The calendar view provides a look at all the engagements and tests occurring during the month d, week or day displayed. Each entry is a direct link to the respective engagement or test view page.\nBenchmarks DefectDojo utilizes the OWASP ASVS Benchmarks to benchmark a product to ensure the product meets your application technical security controls. Benchmarks can be defined per the organizations policy for secure development and multiple benchmarks can be applied to a product.\nBenchmarks are available from the Product view. To view the configured benchmarks select the dropdown menu from the right hand drop down menu. You will find the selection near the bottom of the menu entitled: 'OWASP ASVS v.3.1'.\nIn the Benchmarks view for each product, the default level is ASVS Level\n On the top right hand side the drop down can be changed to the desired ASVS level (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3). The publish checkbox will display the ASVS score on the product page and in the future this will be applied to reporting.  On the left hand side the ASVS score is displayed with the desired score, the % of benchmarks passed to achieve the score and the total enabled benchmarks for that AVSV level.\nAdditional benchmarks can be added/updated in the Django admin site. In a future release this will be brought out to the UI.\nEndpoint Meta Importer For heavy infrastructure scanning organizations, endpoints need to be as flexible as possible to get the most of DefectDojo. This flexibility comes in the form of Tags and custom fields. Tags allow users to filter, sort, and report objects in ways the base object is not totally proficient in doing.\nEndpoint Meta Importer provides a means to apply arbitrary tags and custom fields to endpoints in mass via a CSV file. Tags and customs fields are stored in the format of column:row.\nHere is a very simple example with only two columns:\nhostname | team | public_facing ------------------------------------------------------------------ sheets.google.com | data analytics | yes docs.google.com | language processing | yes feedback.internal.google.com | human resources | no The three endpoints hosts will be used to find existing endpoints with matching hosts, or create new endpoints, and then apply meta as follows:\nsheets.google.com (endpoint) -\u003e [ team:data analytics, public_facing:yes ] (tags) docs.google.com (endpoint) -\u003e [ team:language processing, public_facing:yes ] (tags) feedback.internal.google.com (endpoint) -\u003e [ team:human resources, public_facing:no ] (tags) Endpoint Meta Importer can be found in the Endpoint tab when viewing a Product\nNote: The field “hostname” is required as it is used to query/create endpoints.\n","categories":"","description":"Various features help manage the findings.","excerpt":"Various features help manage the findings.","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/usage/features/","tags":"","title":"Features"},{"body":"Recommended Options  Docker Compose See instructions in DOCKER.md\nSaaS (Includes Support \u0026 Supports the Project) SaaS link\nAWS AMI (Supports the Project) Marketplace link, and complete walkthrough\n Options for the Brave  Kubernetes See instructions in KUBERNETES.md\nLocal install with godojo See instructions in README.md in the godojo repository\n Customizing of settings See Configuration\n","categories":"","description":"DefectDojo supports various installation options.","excerpt":"DefectDojo supports various installation options.","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/getting_started/installation/","tags":"","title":"Installation"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"How to use DefectDojo to manage vulnerabilities","excerpt":"How to use DefectDojo to manage vulnerabilities","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/usage/","tags":"","title":"Usage"},{"body":"To manage expectations, we call this the wishlist.

Upon login with a Google account, a new user will be created if one does not already exist. The criteria for determining whether a user exists is based on the users username. In the event a new user is created, the username is that of the Google address without the domain. Once created, the user creation process will not happen again as the user is recalled by its username, and logged in. In order to make the magic happen, a Google authentication server needs to be created. Closely follow the steps below to guarantee success.\n  Navigate to the following address and either create a new account, or login with an existing one: Google Developers Console\n  Once logged in, find the key shaped button labeled Credentials on the left side of the screen. Click Create Credentials, and choose OAuth Client ID:\n  Select Web Applications, and provide a descriptive name for the client.\n  Add the pictured URLs in the Authorized Redirect URLs section. This part is very important. If there are any mistakes here, the authentication client will not authorize the request, and deny access.\n  Once all URLs are added, finish by clicking Create\n  Now with the authentication client created, the Client ID and Client Secret Key need to be copied over to the settings. Click the newly created client and copy the values:\n  Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_ENABLED=True, DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, '**YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, '**YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**'),  To authorize users you will need to set the following:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_WHITELISTED_DOMAINS = ['example.com', 'example.org']  or\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_WHITELISTED_EMAILS = ['\u003cemail@example.com\u003e']    OKTA In a similar fashion to that of Google, using OKTA as a OAuth2 provider carries the same attributes and a similar procedure. Follow along below.\n  Navigate to the following address and either create a new account, or login with an existing one: OKTA Account Creation\n  Once logged in, enter the Applications and click Add Application:\n  Select Web Applications.\n  Add the pictured URLs in the Login Redirect URLs section. This part is very important. If there are any mistakes here, the authentication client will not authorize the request, and deny access. Check the Implicit box as well.\n  Once all URLs are added, finish by clicking Done.\n  Return to the Dashboard to find the Org-URL. Note this value as it will be important in the settings file.\n  Now, with the authentication client created, the Client ID and Client Secret Key need to be copied over to the settings. Click the newly created client and copy the values:\n  Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_ENABLED=True, DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, '**YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, '**YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_API_URL=(str, 'https://{your-org-url}/oauth2'),    If during the login process you get the following error: The ‘redirect_uri’ parameter must be an absolute URI that is whitelisted in the client app settings. and the redirect_uri HTTP GET parameter starts with http:// instead of https:// you need to add SOCIAL_AUTH_REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS = True in the settings.\nAzure Active Directory Azure AD Configuration You can now use your corporate Azure Active Directory to authenticate users to Defect Dojo. Users will be using your corporate Azure AD account (A.K.A. Office 365 identity) to authenticate via OAuth, and all the conditional access rules and benefits from Azure Active Directory will also apply to the Defect Dojo Authentication. Once the user signs in, it will try to match the UPN of the user to an existing e-mail from a user in Defect Dojo, and if no match is found, a new user will be created in Defect Dojo, associated with the unique id/value of the user provided by your Azure AD tenant. Then, you can assign roles to this user, such as ‘superuser’.\n  Navigate to the following address and follow instructions to create a new app registration\n https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app    Once you register an app, take note of the following information:\n Application (client) ID Directory (tenant) ID Under Certificates \u0026 Secrets, create a new Client Secret    Under Authentication \u003e Redirect URIs, add a WEB type of uri where the redirect points to\n http://localhost:8080/complete/azuread-tenant-oauth2/ OR https://the_hostname_you_have_dojo_deployed:your_server_port/complete/azuread-tenant-oauth2/    Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_TENANT_ID=(str, 'YOUR_DIRECTORY_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_ENABLED = True    Restart your Dojo, and you should now see a Login with Azure AD button on the login page which should magically work\n  Automatic Import of User-Groups To import groups from Azure AD users, the following environment variable needs to be set:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_GET_GROUPS=True   This will ensure the user is added to all the groups found in the Azure AD Token. Any missing groups will be created in DefectDojo (unless filtered). This group synchronization allows for product access via groups to limit the products a user can interact with. Do not activate Emit groups as role claims within the Azure AD “Token configuration”.\nTo prevent authorization creep, old Azure AD groups a user is not having anymore can be deleted with the following environment parameter:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_CLEANUP_GROUPS=True   To limit the amount of groups imported from Azure AD, a regular expression can be used as the following:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_GROUPS_FILTER='^team-.*' # or 'teamA|teamB|groupC'   Gitlab In a similar fashion to that of Google and OKTA, using Gitlab as a OAuth2 provider carries the same attributes and a similar procedure.

SAML 2.0 In a similar direction to OAuth, this SAML addition provides a more secure perogative to SSO. For definitions of terms used and more information, see the plugin plugin homepage.\n  Navigate to your SAML IdP and find your metadata\n  Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SAML2_ENABLED=(bool, **True**), # SAML Login Button Text DD_SAML2_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT=(str, 'Login with SAML'), # If the metadata can be accessed from a url, try the DD_SAML2_METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL=(str, '\u003chttps://your_IdP.com/metadata.xml\u003e'), # Otherwise, downlaod a copy of the metadata into an xml file, and # list the path in DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH=(str, '/path/to/your/metadata.xml'), # Fill in DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP to corresponding SAML2 userprofile attributes provided by your IdP DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP=(dict, { # format: SAML attrib:django_user_model 'Email': 'email', 'UserName': 'username', 'Firstname': 'first_name', 'Lastname': 'last_name' }), # May configure the optional fields    NOTE: DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP in k8s can be referenced as extraConfig (e.g. DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP: 'Email'='email', 'Username'='username'...)\nNOTE: DD_SITE_URL might also need to be set depending on the choices you make with the metadata.xml provider. (File versus URL).\n Checkout the SAML section in dojo/dojo/settings/settings.dist.py and verfiy if it fits your requirement. If you need help, take a look at the plugin documentation.\n  Restart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with SAML button (default setting of DD_SAML2_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT) on the login page.\n  NOTE: In the case when IDP is configured to use self signed (private) certificate, than CA needs to be specified by define environments variable REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE that points to the path of private CA certificate.\nAdvanced Configuration The https://github.com/IdentityPython/djangosaml2 plugin has a lot of options. For details take a look at the plugin documentation. All default options in DefectDojo can overwritten in the local_settings.py. If you want to change the organization name, you can add the following lines:\nif SAML2_ENABLED: SAML_CONFIG['contact_person'] = [{ 'given_name': 'Extra', 'sur_name': 'Example', 'company': 'DefectDojo', 'email_address': 'dummy@defectdojo.com', 'contact_type': 'technical' }] SAML_CONFIG['organization'] = { 'name': [('DefectDojo', 'en')], 'display_name': [('DefectDojo', 'en')], }, Migration from django-saml2-auth Up to relase 1.15.0 the SAML integration was based on https://github.com/fangli/django-saml2-auth. Which the switch to djangosaml2 some parameters has changed:\n DD_SAML2_ASSERTION_URL: not necessary any more - automatically generated DD_SAML2_DEFAULT_NEXT_URL: not necessary any more - default forwarding from defectdojo is used DD_SAML2_NEW_USER_PROFILE: not possible any more - default profile is used, see User Permissions DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP: Syntax has changed DD_SAML2_CREATE_USER: Default value changed to False, to avoid security breaches  RemoteUser This implementation is suitable if the DefectDojo instance is placed behind HTTP Authentication Proxy. Dojo expects that the proxy will perform authentication and pass HTTP requests to the Dojo instance with filled HTTP headers. The proxy should check if an attacker is not trying to add a malicious HTTP header and bypass authentication.\nValues which need to be set:\n DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_ENABLED - Needs to be set to True DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_USERNAME_HEADER - Name of the header which contains the username DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_EMAIL_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the email DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_FIRSTNAME_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the first name DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_LASTNAME_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the last name DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_GROUPS_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the comma-separated list of groups; user will be assigned to these groups (missing groups will be created) DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_GROUPS_CLEANUP(optional) - Same as [#automatic-import-of-user-groups](AzureAD implementation) DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_TRUSTED_PROXY - Comma separated list of proxies; Simple IP and CIDR formats are supported DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_LOGIN_ONLY(optional) - Check Django documentation  WARNING: There is possible spoofing of headers (for all DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_xxx_HEADER values). Read Warning in Django documentation\nUser Permissions When a new user is created via the social-auth, only the default permissions are active. This means that the newly created user does not have access to add, edit, nor delete anything within DefectDojo. There are two parameters in the System Settings to influence the permissions for newly created users:\nDefault group When both the parameters Default group and Default group role are set, the new user will be a member of the given group with the given role, which will give him the respective permissions.\nLogin speed-up You can bypass the login form if you are only using SSO/Social authentication for login in by enabling these two environment variables:\nDD_SOCIAL_LOGIN_AUTO_REDIRECT: \"true\" DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_SHOW_LOGIN_FORM: \"false\" Login form fallback If you are using “login speed-up”, it can be useful to be able to login by the standard way, for example when an admin user needs to log in because of a change of some settings or permissions. This feature is accessible by a visiting the URL \u003cDD_HOST\u003e/login?force_login_form.\nOther Providers In an effort to accommodate as much generality as possible, it was decided to implement OAuth2 with the social-auth ecosystem as it has a library of compatible providers with documentation of implementation. Conveniently, each provider has an identical procedure of managing the authenticated responses and authorizing access within a given application. The only difficulty is creating a new authentication client with a given OAuth2 provider.\n","categories":"","description":"OAuth2/SAML2 let users authenticate against enterprise directories.","excerpt":"OAuth2/SAML2 let users authenticate against enterprise directories.","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/integrations/social-authentication/","tags":"","title":"Authentication via OAuth2/SAML2"},{"body":"Regular releases The DefectDojo team aims to meet the following cadence:\n Minor releases at least once a month on the first Monday of the month Patch/Bugfix releases every Monday Security releases can come at any time.

They can change all settings, manage users and have read and write access to all data. Staff users can add Product Types, and have access to data according to their role in a Product or Product Type. Regular users have limited functionality available. They cannot add Product Types but have access to data according to their role in a Product or Product Type  Product and Product Type permissions Users can be assigned as members to Products and Product Types, giving them one out of five predefined roles. The role defines what kind of access a user has to functions for interacting with data of that Product or Product Type:\nProduct / Product Type roles:\n    Reader Writer Maintainer Owner API Importer     Add Product Type   1) 1)    View Product Type x x x x x   Remove yourself as a member x x x x    Manage Product Type members   x x    Edit Product Type   x x    Add Product   x x    Add Product Type member as Owner    x    Delete Product Type    x            View Product x x x x x   Remove yourself as a member x x x x    Manage Product members   x x    Edit Product   x x    Add Product member as Owner    x    Delete Product    x            View Engagement x x x x x   Add Engagement  x x x    Edit Engagement  x x x    Risk Acceptance  x x x    Delete Engagement   x x            View Test x x x x x   Add Test  x x x    Edit Test  x x x    Delete Test   x x            View Finding x x x x x   Add Finding  x x x    Edit Finding  x x x    (Re-)Import Scan Result  x x x x   Delete Finding   x x            View Finding Group x x x x x   Add Finding Group  x x x    Edit Finding Group  x x x    Delete Finding Group  x x x            View Endpoint x x x x x   Add Endpoint  x x x    Edit Endpoint  x x x    Delete Endpoint   x x            Edit Benchmark  x x x    Delete Benchmark   x x            View Components x x x x x           View Note History x x x x    Add Note x x x x    Edit Note (x) 2) x x x    Delete Note (x) 2) (x) 2) x x     1) Every superuser can add Product Types. Regular users are not allowed to add Product Types, unless they are Global Owner or Maintainer.\n2) Every user is allowed to edit and delete his own notes.\nThe role of a user within a Product Type is inherited by all Products of that Product Type, unless the user is explicitly defined as a member of a Product with a different role. In that case, if a user doesn’t have a certain right for the Product Type, it is then checked if he has the right for the Product.\nA Product Type needs to have at least one owner. The last owner cannot be removed.\nGlobal permissions Users can be assigned a global role in the Edit User dialog. A global role gives a user access to all Product Types and Products, including the underlying data, with permissions according to the respective role.\nA use case for a global role could be the Chief Information Security Officer of a company who needs an overview of all systems. If he gets the global role Reader, he can see the findings for all products and also all metrics.\nSince global roles give users access to all data, only superusers are allowed to edit it.\nGroups If you have a number of users who should all have the same permissions for some Products or Product Types, you can put them together in a group. The group defines the roles for Products and Product Types that are applied to all members of the group.\nThe membership of a group itself has a role that determines what permissions the member has to manage the group:\n    Reader Maintainer Owner     Add Group 1)      View Group x x x   Remove yourself as a member x x x   Manage Group members  x x   Edit Group  x x   Add Group member as Owner   x   Delete Group   x    1) Every superuser can add groups.

DefectDojo includes functionality to create new questionnaires with custom questions, open questionnaires to receive responses for certain time periods from insiders or outsiders, and connect questionnaires with new or existing engagements.\nCreating a New Questionnaire To access, create, or modify new/existing questionnaires, navigate to the All Questionnaires dashboard from the sidebar.\nOn the questionnaire dashboard, all existing questionnaires are displayed. To quickly find a questionnaire, the filters may be used to search for snippets within the questionnaire name and/or description, as well as by active/inactive status.\nWhen questionnaires are open for responses, they will be displayed in the General Questionnaires block towards the bottom of the page.\nTo begin the process of creating a new questionnaire, select the Create Questionnaire button located in the top right of the questionnaire dashboard.\nQuestionnaires have a name and description, as well as an activity status, which are initially set on questionnaire creation, but can be modified in the future if necessary. Once these fields are filled in appropriately, the user can create the questionnaire without any questions (by selecting Create Questionnaire), or with questions (by selecting Create Questionnaire and Add Questions).\nTo add questions to a questionnaire, select the dropdown titled Select as many Questions as applicable, which will open all of the existing questions within DefectDojo. Once the desired questions are selected from the list, the dropdown can be closed, and the Update Questionnaire Questions can be selected to save the newly created questionnaire.\nNote: New questions may also be added at the time of questionnaire creation by selecting the plus located next to the questions dropdown.\nCreating New Questions The questions dashboard displays all of the questions that may exist as part of questionnaires within DefectDojo. Similar to questionnaires, to quickly find a question, the filters may be used to search for optional status, or snippets within the question name and/or description. Two types of questions exist within DefectDojo questionnaires: Text Questions and Multiple Choice Questions. To add a new question, select the Create Question button located in the top right of the questions dashboard.\nAdding Text Questions To add a text question (open-ended), fill out the add question form, where:\n Type - The type of question being created, in this case Text. Order - The order of a question describes its position in a questionnaire relative to other questions (e.g., an order of 1 will put the question higher than a question with order 4). Optional - When the optional box is checked, a question will not be required in a questionnaire. Question Text - The text that is displayed to prompt a user for their answer (e.g. What is your favorite color?).  Adding Multiple Choice Questions Similar to the process of adding a text question, choice questions (non-open-ended) allow the user to pick from a given list of choices. To add a choice question, fill out the add question form, where:\n Type - The type of question being created, in this case Choice. Order - The order of a question describes its position in a questionnaire relative to other questions (e.g., an order of 1 will put the question higher than a question with order 4). Optional - When the optional box is checked, a question will not be required in a questionnaire. Multichoice - When the multichoice box is checked, multiple choices from the list of choices may be selected by the user. Answer Choices - The possible answer choices that may be selected by a user.  Publishing a Questionnaire Once a questionnaire has been successfully created, it can be published to accept responses. To publish a questionnaire, select the plus located to the right of General Questionnaires.\nThis will prompt for a specific questionnaire to be selected, as well as a date the questionnaire response window should close. The response window sets a due date for recipients. Once these two options have been selected, publish the questionnaire by selecting Add Questionnaire.\nOnce a questionnaire is published, a link to share it can be retrieved by selecting the Share Questionnaire action. To ensure the newly created questionnaire has been constructed as expected, open the share link and view the newly created questionnaire.\nUnassigned Questionnaires When a questionnaire’s response window has closed, all of the responses will be saved, and the questionnaire will be listed as an Unassigned Answered Engagement Questionnaire on the DefectDojo dashboard.\nThere are three actions that may be taken when a questionnaire’s response window has closed: View Responses, Create Engagement, and Assign User.\nView Questionnaire Responses To view the questionnaire responses, select the View Responses action. All of the responses from the questionnaire will be displayed.\nCreate an Engagement From a Questionnaire To link the questionnaire to a product via an engagement, select the Create Engagement action. Once a product is selected from the dropdown, select Create Engagement. This will link the questionnaire results with a new engagement under the selected product, which can then be given specific details similar to other engagements in DefectDojo, such as Description, Version, Status, Tags, etc.\nTo view a questionnaire at the engagement level, navigate to the engagement linked with the desired questionnaire. Expand the Additional Features menu to reveal a Questionnaires dropdown, which will contain all of the linked questionnaires.\nAssign a Questionnaire to a User To assign a questionnaire to a user, select the Assign User action. This will prompt for a user to be selected from the dropdown of available users. Once a user is selected, assign the questionnaire to the specified user by selecting Assign Questionnaire.\nCreating Questionnaires From Engagements While questionnaires are commonly created from the questionnaire dashboard, they can also be created at the engagement level. To create a new questionnaire from within an engagement, expand the Additional Features dropdown to reveal the Questionnaires dropdown. In the right side header of the Questionnaires dropdown, select the plus to link a new questionnaire.\nOnce prompted, select a questionnaire from the available surveys list to link it with the engagement. If the user wishes to leave a response at the time of linking the questionnaire with the engagement, the Add Questionnaire and Repond option may be selected. To simply link the questionnaire with the engagement, select Add Questionnaire.\nAnonymous Questionnaires Questionnaires, by default, are only accessible by DefectDojo users. To allow outside responses to DefectDojo questionnaires, ensure the Allow Anonymous Survey Reponses option within the System Settings is selected.

Here he sets some basic information, like how long he expects the Engagement will take, who will be leading the testing (himself), what Product he will be working on, and what tests he will be doing.\nNext, he can add a Test to the Engagement, or upload a Nessus scan and start picking out the real vulnerabilities from the false positives (Nessus scan Findings are imported as inactive by default).\nWithin the Test section, Bill can add Findings for any issues that he has uncovered during his audit. He can assign a severity to the Findings, describe replication steps, mitigation strategies, and impact on the system. This will come in handy when he wants to generate a report to send to the development team responsible for this Product, or his manager.\nOnce Bill has completed his Engagement, he can close the Engagement on the main Engagement page. He can then view the results of his Tests, and generate a report to send to the development team.\nIf Bill hears back from the development team that they won't be able to fix the issue for a while, he can make a note of this on the Engagement page. Bill will also receive Alerts for any bugs that persist longer than they are supposed to based on their severity.\nExample 2 - John the QE manager John wants to keep tabs on what his team members are up to, and find issues that are taking a long time to get fixed.

He can also look at all the Findings for which there is a Risk Acceptance associated, and ensure that the proper documentation or timeline has been provided for the Findings in question.\nIf he wants to check on a particular team member's progress, he can look at the Engineer Metrics dashboard under \"Additional Metrics\" for that user.\n","categories":"","description":"Two examples how DefectDojo can be used in day-to-day operations.","excerpt":"Two examples how DefectDojo can be used in day-to-day operations.","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/usage/workflows/","tags":"","title":"Example workflows"},{"body":"DefectDojo's JIRA integration is bidirectional. You may push findings to JIRA and share comments. If an issue is closed in JIRA it will automatically be closed in Dojo.\nNOTE: These steps will configure the necessary webhook in JIRA and add JIRA integration into DefectDojo. This isn't sufficient by itself, you will need to configure products and findings to push to JIRA. On a product's settings page you will need to define a:\n Project Key (and this project must exist in JIRA) JIRA Configuration (select the JIRA configuration that you create in the steps below) Component (can be left blank)  Then elect (via tickbox) whether you want to 'Push all issues', 'Enable engagement epic mapping' and/or 'Push notes'.

This file can be modified to your needs, rebuild all containers afterwards. There’s also a more limited template available, which can be chosen when configuring a JIRA Instance or JIRA Project for a Product or Engagement:\nAny folder added to dojo/templates/issue-trackers/ will be added to the dropdown (after rebuilding/restarting the containers).\nEngagement Epic Mapping If creating an Engagement, ensure to tick ‘Enable engagement epic mapping’ if desired. This can also be done after engagement creation on the edit engagement page. This will create an ‘Epic’ type issue within Jira. All findings in the engagement pushed to Jira will have a link to this Epic issue. If Epic Mapping was enabled after associated findings have already been pushed to Jira, simply pushing them again will link the Jira issue to the Epic issue.\nPushing findings Findings can be pushed to Jira in a number of ways:\n When importing scanner reports, select ‘Push to JIRA’ to push every single finding in the report to Jira When creating a new finding, select ‘Push to JIRA’ and submit. This will create the finding in DefectDojo and Jira simultaneously If a finding already exist, visit the edit finding page and find the ‘Push to JIRA’ tick box at the bottom When viewing a list of findings, select each relevant tick boxes to the left of the finding, and click the ‘Bulk Edit’ button at the top. find ‘Push to JIRA’ at the bottom of the menu  Status Sync DefectDojo will try to keep the status in sync with the status in JIRA using the Close and Reopen transition IDs configured for each JIRA instance. This will only work if your workflow in JIRA allows the Close transition to be performed from every status a JIRA issue can be in.\nKnown Issues The Risk Acceptance feature in DefectDojo will (for that reason) not (yet) try to sync statuses. A comment will be pushed to JIRA if a finding is risk accepted or unaccepted. Contributions are welcome to enhance the integration.\nStatus reconciliation Sometimes JIRA is down, or Defect Dojo is down, or there was bug in a webhook. In this case JIRA can become out of sync with Defect Dojo. If this is the case for lots of issues, manual reconciliation might not be feasible. For this scenario there is the management command ‘jira_status_reconciliation’.\nusage: manage.py jira_status_reconciliation [-h] [--mode MODE] [--product PRODUCT] [--engagement ENGAGEMENT] [--dryrun] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] Reconcile finding status with JIRA issue status, stdout will contain semicolon seperated CSV results.

This feature works in most use cases, but struggles when doing things such as pushing to Jira during the import process. Because Endpoints are still being processed and created even after the import procedure is completed, pushing Findings to Jira can result in incomplete Jira tickets. It is advised to wait until after import has been completed 100%.\nTo enable this feature, set ASYNC_FINDING_IMPORT to True in local_settings.py\nAsynchronous Delete For larger instances, deleting an object can take minutes for all related objects to be expanded into memory, rendered on the page, and then removing all objects from the database. To combat this issue, two settings can be set in local_settings.py:\nASYNC_OBJECT_DELETE Deleting an object asynchronously changes the way an object is deleted under the hood. By removing the need to expand into memory, a lot of time (and memory) can be saved by offloading the lookups and removals onto celery processes. This process works by starting at the bottom of a given object, and walking the tree upwards rather than downwards. This way, objects can be seperated into buckets, and then deleted.\nDELETE_PREVIEW Previewing all the objects to be deleted takes almost as much time as deleting the objects itself. This is a safety feature intended to warn users of what they are about to delete, as well as educating users of how the delete functionality works by cascade deleting all related objects. With this feature enabled, the user will only see the following text in the delete preview (without any database lookups)\nPreviewing the relationships has been disabled.\n","categories":"","description":"Settings to configure to enhance performance in DefectDojo","excerpt":"Settings to configure to enhance performance in DefectDojo","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/usage/performance/","tags":"","title":"Performance Enhancements"},{"body":"Production with docker-compose The docker-compose.yml file in this repository is fully functional to evaluate DefectDojo in your local environment.\nAlthough Docker Compose is one of the supported installation methods to deploy a containerized DefectDojo in a production environment, the docker-compose.yml file is not intended for production use without first customizing it to your particular situation.\nSee Running with Docker Compose for more information how to run DefectDojo with Docker Compose.\nDatabase performance and backup It is recommended to use a dedicated database server and not the preconfigured MySQL database. This will improve the performance of DefectDojo\nIn both case, if you use a dedicated database server or if you should decide to use the preconfigured MySQL database, make sure to make regular backups of the data. For a dedicated database server follow the instructions that come with the database server. For the preconfigured MySQL you can use mysqldump, e.g. as described in How to backup a Docker MySQL database.\nBackup of Media files Media files for uploaded files, including threat models and risk acceptance, are stored in a docker volume. This volume needs to be backed up regularly.\nInstance size Information Please read the paragraphs below about key processes tweaks.  Having taken the database to run elsewhere, the minimum recommendation is:\n 2 vCPUs 8 GB of RAM 2 GB of disk space (remember, your database is not here -- so basically, what you have for your O/S should do). You could allocate a different disk than your OS's for potential performance improvements.  Key processes Per https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/2813, it is now easy to somewhat improve the uWSGI and celery worker performance.\nuWSGI By default (except in ptvsd mode for debug purposes), uWSGI will handle 4 concurrent connections.\nBased on your resource settings, you can tweak:\n DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_PROCESSES for the number of spawned processes. (default 2) DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_THREADS for the number of threads in these processes. (default 2)  For example, you may have 4 processes with 6 threads each, yielding 24 concurrent connections.\nCelery worker By default, a single mono-process celery worker is spawned. This is fine until you start having many findings, and when async operations like deduplication start to kick in. Eventually, it will starve your resources and crawl to a halt, while operations continue to queue up.\nThe following variables will help a lot, while keeping a single celery worker container.\n DD_CELERY_WORKER_POOL_TYPE will let you switch to prefork. (default solo)  As you've enabled prefork, the following variables have to be used. The default are working fairly well, see the Dockerfile.django-* for in-file references.\n DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MIN defaults to 2. DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MAX defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER defaults to 128.  You can execute the following command to see the configuration:\ndocker-compose exec celerybeat bash -c \"celery -A dojo inspect stats\" and see what is in effect.\nAsynchronous Imports This is an experimental features that has some concerns that need to be addressed before it can be used reliably.\nImport and Re-Import can also be configured to handle uploads asynchronously to aid in importing especially large files. It works by batching Findings and Endpoints by a configurable amount. Each batch will be be processed in seperate celery tasks.\nThe following variables have to be used.\n DD_ASYNC_FINDING_IMPORT defaults to False DD_ASYNC_FINDING_IMPORT_CHUNK_SIZE deafults to 100  When using asynchronous imports with dynamic scanners, Endpoints will continue to “trickle” in even after the import has returned a successful respsonse. This is becasue processing continues to occur after the Findings have already been imported.\nTo determine if an import has been fully completed, please see the progress bar in the appropriate test.\nMonitoring To expose Django statistics for Prometheus, set DJANGO_METRICS_ENABLED to True in the settings (see Configuration).\nThe Prometheus endpoint is than available under the path: http://dd_server/django_metrics/metrics\n","categories":"","description":"Productive use of DefectDojo needs consideration of performance and backups.","excerpt":"Productive use of DefectDojo needs consideration of performance and …","ref":"/django-DefectDojo/getting_started/running-in-production/","tags":"","title":"Running in production"},{"body":"Findings can have a filepath and a line number as the location of the vulnerability.

The generic upgrade method for docker-compose follows these steps:\n  Pull the latest version\ndocker pull defectdojo/defectdojo-django:latest docker pull defectdojo/defectdojo-nginx:latest   If you would like to use something older (so not the latest version), specify the version (tag) you want to upgrade to:\ndocker pull defectdojo/defectdojo-django:1.10.2 docker pull defectdojo/defectdojo-nginx:1.10.2   If you would like to use alpine based images, you specify the version (tag) you want to upgrade to:\ndocker pull defectdojo/defectdojo-django:1.10.2-alpine docker pull defectdojo/defectdojo-nginx:1.10.2-alpine   Go to the directory where your docker-compose.yml file lives\n  Stop DefectDojo: ./dc-stop.sh\n  Re-start DefectDojo, allowing for container recreation: ./dc-up-d.sh\n  Database migrations will be run automatically by the initializer. Check the output via docker-compose logs initializer or relevant k8s command\n  If you have the initializer disabled (or if you want to be on the safe side), run the migration command: docker-compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c 'python manage.py migrate\n  Building your local images If you build your images locally and do not use the ones from DockerHub, the instructions are much the same, except that you’d build your images first. (Of course, if you’re doing this, then you know you have to update the source code first)\nReplace the first step above with this one: docker-compose build\ngodojo installations If you have installed DefectDojo on “iron” and wish to upgrade the installation, please see the instructions in the repo.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.19.x There are new docker images based on alpine with fewer third party dependencies. Related to the new images the current docker files had to be renamed and have a “-debian” or the new images a “-alpine” at the end. Furthermore there are new docker tags [DefectdojoVersion]-[OS]. For example 2.19.0-alpine or 2.19.0-debian. The currend tags (latest and [DefectdojoVersion]) are still based on the “old” images. Be aware that the new alpine images are not heavily tested and may contain bugs.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.18.x Upgrade instructions for helm chart with rabbitMQ enabled: The rabbitMQ uses a statefulset by default. Before upgrading the helm chart we have to ensure that all queues are empty:\nkubectl exec -i \u003cname_of_the_rabbitmq_pod\u003e -- rabbitmqctl list_queues Next step is to delete rabbitMQ pvc:\nkubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=rabbitmq Last step is to perform the upgrade.\nFor more information: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/rabbitmq/11.2.0\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.17.x.

There are no special instruction for upgrading to 2.16.0. Check the Release Notes for the contents of the release.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.15.x. There are no special instruction for upgrading to 2.15.0. Check the Release Notes for the contents of the release.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.13.x. The last release implemented the search for vulnerability ids, but the search database was not initialized. To populate the database table of the vulnerability ids, execute this django command from the defect dojo installation directory or from a shell of the Docker container or Kubernetes pod:\n./manage.py migrate_cve\nAdditionally this requires a one-time rebuild of the Django-Watson search index. Execute this django command from the defect dojo installation directory or from a shell of the Docker container or Kubernetes pod:\n./manage.py buildwatson\nUpgrade instructions for helm chart with postgres enabled: The postgres database uses a statefulset by default. Before upgrading the helm chart we have to delete the statefullset and ensure that the pvc is reused, to keep the data. For more information: https://docs.bitnami.com/kubernetes/infrastructure/postgresql/administration/upgrade/ .\nhelm repo update helm dependency update ./helm/defectdojo # obtain name oft the postgres pvc export POSTGRESQL_PVC=$(kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=defectdojo,role=primary -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\") # delete postgres statefulset kubectl delete statefulsets.apps defectdojo-postgresql --namespace default --cascade=orphan # upgrade helm upgrade \\  defectdojo \\  ./helm/defectdojo/ \\  --set primary.persistence.existingClaim=$POSTGRESQL_PVC \\  ... # add your custom settings Further changes:\nLegacy authorization for changing configurations based on staff users has been removed.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.12.x. Breaking change for search: The field cve has been removed from the search index for Findings and the Vulnerability Ids have been added to the search index. With this the syntax to search explicitly for vulnerability ids have been changed from cve: to vulnerability_id:, e.g. vulnerability_id:CVE-2020-27619.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.10.x. Breaking change for Findings: The field cve will be replaced by a list of Vulnerability Ids, which can store references to security advisories associated with this finding. These can be Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) or from other sources, eg. GitHub Security Advisories. Although the field does still exist in the code, the API and the UI have already been changed to use the list of Vulnerability Ids. Other areas like hash code calculation, search and parsers will be migrated step by step in later stages.\nThis change also causes an API change for the endpoint /engagements/{id}/accept_risks/.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.9.x. Breaking change for APIv2: configuration_url was removed from API endpoint /api/v2/tool_configurations/ due to redundancy.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.8.x. Breaking change for Docker Compose: Starting DefectDojo with Docker Compose now supports 2 databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL) and 2 celery brokers (RabbitMQ and Redis). To make this possible, docker-compose needs to be started with the parameters --profile and --env-file. You can get more information in Setup via Docker Compose - Profiles. The profile mysql-rabbitmq provides the same configuration as in previous releases. With this the prerequisites have changed as well: Docker requires at least version 19.03.0 and Docker Compose 1.28.0.\nBreaking change for Helm Chart: In one of the last releases we upgraded the redis dependency in our helm chart without renaming keys in our helm chart. We fixed this bug with this release, but you may want to check if all redis values are correct (Pull Request).\nThe flexible permissions for the configuration of DefectDojo are now active by default. With this, the flag Staff for users is not relevant and not visible anymore. The old behaviour can still be activated by setting the parameter FEATURE_CONFIGURATION_AUTHORIZATION to False. If you haven’t done so with the previous release, you can still run a migration script with ./manage.py migrate_staff_users. This script:\n creates a group for all staff users, sets all configuration permissions that staff users had and sets the global Owner role, if AUTHORIZATION_STAFF_OVERRIDE is set to True.  Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.7.x. This release is a breaking change regarding the Choctaw Hog parser. As the maintainers of this project unified multiple parsers under the RustyHog parser, we now support the parsing of Choctaw Hog JSON output files through the Rusty Hog parser. Furthermore, we also support Gottingen Hog and Essex Hog JSON output files with the RustyHog parser.\nThere is another breaking change regarding the import of SSLyze scans. The parser has been renamed from SSLyze 3 Scan (JSON) to SSLyze Scan (JSON). The data in the database is fixed by the initializer, but it may break scripted API calls.\nRelease 2.7.0 contains a beta functionality to make permissions for the configuration of DefectDojo more flexible. When the settings parameter FEATURE_CONFIGURATION_AUTHORIZATION is set to True, many configuration dialogues and API endpoints can be enabled for users or groups of users, regardless of their Superuser or Staff status, see Configuration Permissions.\nThe functionality using the flag AUTHORIZATION_STAFF_OVERRIDE has been removed. The same result can be achieved with giving the staff users a global Owner role.\nTo support the transition for these 2 changes, you can run a migration script with ./manage.py migrate_staff_users. This script:\n creates a group for all staff users, sets all configuration permissions that staff users had and sets the global Owner role, if AUTHORIZATION_STAFF_OVERRIDE is set to True.  Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.6.x. There are no special instruction for upgrading to 2.6.0. Check the Release Notes for the contents of the release.\nPlease consult the security advisories GHSA-f82x-m585-gj24 (moderate) and GHSA-v7fv-g69g-x7p2 (high) to see what security issues were fixed in this release. These will be published and become visible at January 18th, 2022.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.5.x. Legacy authorization has been completely removed with version 2.5.0. This includes removal of the migration of users to the new authorization as described in https://documentation.defectdojo.com/getting_started/upgrading/#authorization. If you are still using the legacy authorization, you should run the migration with ./manage.py migrate_authorization_v2 before upgrading to version 2.5.0\nThis release introduces the “Forgot password” functionality (DD_FORGOT_PASSWORD: default True). The function allows sending an e-mail with the reset password link. Missing configuration or misconfiguration of SMTP (DD_EMAIL_URL) could raise an error (HTTP-500). Check and test (for example by resetting your own password) if you configured SMTP correctly. If you want to avoid HTTP-500 and you don’t want to set up SMTP, you can just simply switch off the “Forgot password” functionality (DD_FORGOT_PASSWORD=False).\nRelease renamed system setting mail_notifications_from to email_from. This value will not be used only for sending notifications but also for sending the reset password emails. It is highly recommended to check the content of this value if you are satisfied. If you installed DefectDojo earlier, you can expect \"from@example.com\" there. A fresh installation will use \"no-reply@example.com\"\nThis release updates our helm dependencies. There is a breaking change if you are using the mysql database from the helm chart because we replaced the deprecated chart from the stable repo with a chart from bitnami. If you have persistance enabled, ensure to backup your data before upgrading. All data get lost when replacing the mysql chart during the upgrade. For data migration take a look at the mysql backup and restore process.\nFurthermore we updated our kubernetes version. Current tests run on 1.18.16 and 1.22.0.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.4.x. (Security Release) This releases fixes a High severity vulnerability for which the details will be disclosed on November 16th in GHSA-fwg9-752c-qh8w\nThere is a breaking change in the API for importing and re-importings scans with SonarQube API and Cobalt.io API. The scan configurations have been unified and are set now with the attribute api_scan_configuration. The existing configurations for SonarQube API and Cobalt.io API have been migrated.\nAt the request of pyup.io, we had to remove the parser for Safety scans.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.3.x. There are no special instruction for upgrading to 2.3.0. In 2.3.0 we changed the default password hashing algorithm to Argon2 (from PBKDF2). When logging in, exising hashes get replaced by an Argon2 hash. If you want to rehash password without users having to login, please see the Django password management docs. The previous password hashing algorithm (PBKDF2) was not unsafe, but we wanted to follow the OWASP guidelines.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.2.x. Upgrade to 2.0.0 contained migration of endpoints. Some parts of migration haven’t been done properly. This deficiency may manifest as a doubled slash in endpoint URLs (like http://foo.bar:8080//test) or as a problem with deduplication of the same endpoints. The mentioned bug was fixed in 2.2.0 and if you have seen these kinds of problems, just rerun “Endpoint migration” as it is written in Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.0.x..\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.0.x. Follow the usual steps to upgrade as described above.\nBEFORE UPGRADING\n If you are using SAML2 checkout the new documentaion and update you settings following the migration section. We replaced django-saml2-auth with djangosaml2.  AFTER UPGRADING\n Usual migration process (python manage.py migrate) try to migrate all endpoints to new format and merge duplicates. All broken endpoints (which weren’t possible to migrate) have red flag 🚩 in standard list of endpoints. Check if all your endpoints was migrated successfully, go to: https:///endpoint/migrate. Alternatively, this can be run as management command: docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py endpoint_migration --dry-run When all endpoint will be fixed (there is not broken endpoint), press “Run migration” in https:///endpoint/migrate Or, you can run management command: docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py endpoint_migration Details about endpoint migration / improvements in https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/4473  We decided to name this version 2.0.0 because we did some big cleanups in this release:\n  Remove API v1 (#4413)\n  Remove setup.bash installation method (#4417)\n  Rename Finding.is_Mitigated field to Finding.is_mitigated (#3854)\n  Remove everything related to the old tagging library (#4419)\n  Remove S0/S1/S2../S5 severity display option (#4415)\n  Refactor EndPoint handling/formatting (#4473)\n  Upgrade to Django 3.x (#3632)\n  PDF Reports removed (#4418)\n  Hashcode calculation logic has changed. To update existing findings run:\n./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only.\n  If you’re using docker:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only.\nThis can take a while depending on your instance size.\n See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.0.0  Endpoints  The usual migration process (python manage.py migrate) tries to migrate all endpoints to new format and merge duplicates.

The fields for authorized users are not available anymore, but you can assign roles as described in Permissions. Users are migrated automatically, so that their permissions are as close as possible to the previous authorization:\n Superusers will still have all permissions on Products and Product Types, so they must not be changed. Staff users have had all permissions for all product types and products, so they will be get a global role as Owner. Product_Members and Product Type_Members will be added for authorized users according to the settings for the previous authorization:  The Reader role is set as the default. If AUTHORIZED_USERS_ALLOW_STAFF is True, the user will get the Owner role for the respective Product or Product Type. If AUTHORIZED_USERS_ALLOW_CHANGE or AUTHORIZED_USERS_ALLOW_DELETE is True, the user will get the Writer role for the respective Product or Product Type.    The new authorization is active for both UI and API. Permissions set via authorized users or via the Django Admin interface are no longer taken into account.\nPlease review the roles for your users after the upgrade to avoid an unintended permissions creep.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.15.x   See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.15.0\n  If you have made changes to JIRA templates or the template config in the JIRA Project config for instances/products/engagements: The jira template settings introduced in 1.13 have been changed. You now have to select a subfolder instead of a sinlge template file. If you have chosen a non-default template here, you have to reapply that to all products / engagements. Also you have to move your custom templates into the correct subfolder in dojo/templates/issue-trackers/.\n  Hashcode calculation logic has changed in #4134, #4308 and #4310 to update existing findings run:\n./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only\n  If you’re using docker:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only\nThis can take a while depending on your instance size.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.14.x  See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.14.0  Note that the below fields are now optional without default value. They will not be filled anymore with values such as “No references given” when found empty while saving the findings\n mitigation references impact url  Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.13.x   See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.13.0\n  Hashcode settings affecting deduplication have changed, to update existing findings run:\n./manage.py dedupe\n  If you’re using docker:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe  This can take a while depeneding on your instance size. It might possible that new duplicates are detected among existing findings, so make a backup before running!\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.12.x  See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.12.0 1.12.1 is a security release https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.12.1  Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.11.x  See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.11.0 1.11.1 is a security release https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.11.1  Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.10.x 1.10.4 is a security release\n See the security advisory: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/security/advisories/GHSA-96vq-gqr9-vf2c See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.10.4 Version 1.10.4 replaces 1.10.3 as the latter contained an incomplete fix  What's New:\n See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases DefectDojo now provides a settings.py file out-of-the-box. Custom settings need to go into local\\_settings.py. See https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/settings/settings.py and https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/docker/extra_settings/README.md A quickfix is to rename your own / customized settings.py or settings.dist.py to local\\_settings.py. Details of that PR: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/3136 Major JIRA integration refactoring, for which you should at least use 1.10.1 and not 1.10.0 for many bug fixes.  Breaking changes\nKubernetes/Helm users: we have moved away from the \"stable\" repository to \"bitnami\" in this release. The bitnami postgresql chart required us to add a new key to the postgresql secret, which will give you the error postgresql-postgres-password is missing if you have createPostgresqlSecret: false. In 1.10.1, a fix was also included to allow your existing postgresqlPassword to be reused properly.\nIncluding in 1.10.1 were a couple fixes related to a rabbitMQ upgrade. The path to access password, erlangCookie and existingPasswordSecret changed from rabbitmq to auth. Furthermore, as rabbitMQ is deployed as a StatefulSet, an in-place upgrade is not possible and an error will likely be thrown such as Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden. After ensuring your rabbitMQ celery queue is empty, you will then want to delete your rabbitMQ StatefulSet and PVC to allow them to get re-created, or fully delete and recreate defectdojo.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.9.3 This is a security release\n See the security advisory See release notes  What's New:\n See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases  NOTE:\nWhen upgrading from before 1.9.2, a corrective script may need to be ran\n./manage.py create\\_endpoint\\_status\nIf you're using docker:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py create\\_endpoint\\_status\nThis can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of findings in your instance.\n Search index tweaking index rebuild after upgrade:  This requires a (one-time) rebuild of the Django-Watson search index.
